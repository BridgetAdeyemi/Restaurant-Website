**Restaurant Website Recreation Project**    

This project is a recreation of a restaurant website, one of my earliest projects built using HTML and CSS. It was designed for desktop view only and served as a learning exercise to practice and improve my web development skills.

**Overview**    
The restaurant website was replicated to better understand the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This project focuses on creating a structured layout, with attention to styling for a desktop-only view, as responsive design was not implemented at this stage.

**Key Feature**
- Designed for desktop view only.
- Structured and styled using HTML and CSS.
- Simple, clean layout aimed at improving my skills in web development.
  
**Purpose**    
The project was created as a learning experience, allowing me to practice HTML5 for structuring content and CSS3 for styling. It provided an opportunity to develop my understanding of basic web design techniques.

**Technologies Used**
- HTML5 for content structure.
- CSS3 for styling and layout.
